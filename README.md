Overview

Crimson Quest is a personal development project that draws inspiration from the color crimson,
which is the national color of Nepal, and is also the official color of Harvard University. The
project seeks to embody the spirit of learning and growth that is synonymous with Harvard
University living in Nepal, and to foster a mindset of continuous self-improvement.
The central goal of Crimson Quest is to gain knowledge and skills that are on par with the level
of Harvard University. This involves a commitment to lifelong learning and a willingness to
challenge oneself intellectually. The project recognizes that education is not limited to formal
classroom settings, and encourages exploration and experimentation in various fields of study.
In addition to academic pursuits, Crimson Quest emphasizes personal development and
self-awareness. The project encourages individuals to reflect on their values, beliefs, and goals,
and to develop a strong sense of purpose and direction in life. It also emphasizes the importance
of developing positive habits and routines, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and
mindfulness practices.
Overall, Crimson Quest is a project that embodies the ideals of learning, growth, and
self-improvement. It seeks to inspire individuals to strive for excellence in all areas of their lives,
and to develop a sense of purpose and meaning that transcends traditional notions of success.

This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by **David J. Malan**, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.

Here are some introductory courses, that I will be taking:

1. **CS50**
1. **Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python**
1. **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming**
1. **CS50-Python**
1. **One TED Talk everyday**
